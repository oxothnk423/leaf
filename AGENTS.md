# Agent Notes

## factory_interface setup tasks

- The `/setup` workflow does not use per-browser sessions. It is backed by process-wide module-level task singletons in `factory_interface/src/factory_interface/*_task.py` and `commissioning_tasks.py`. Multiple operators/browser tabs share the same setup task state.
- `/setup` calls `reset_setup_tasks_if_complete()` when the page loads. If any setup task is still `running`, state is preserved and the frontend rehydrates by polling the task GET endpoints. If no task is running and any task is complete/failed, the checklist is reset to idle on page load.
- The setup page auto-chains tasks in JavaScript: flash success starts discovery, discovery success starts nonvolatile reset, reset success starts MAC read, and MAC read success starts the interactive self-test. When changing terminal states, check that the frontend does not accidentally start the next task.
- The active post-discovery commissioning flow redirects from `/setup` to `/setup/{mac_address}` and runs the per-device session tasks there. Keep shared checklist rows in `setup_checklist.html` and `setup_session.html` visually in sync even when the `/setup` row is mostly a compatibility display.
- After the interactive self-test, the commissioning session runs a `retrieve_test_details` task. It calls the device webserver's `GET /self-test/details` endpoint, which streams the highest-numbered `/self_test_N.txt` file from the SD card as plain text, then stores that text in the session and persisted `test_results`.
- Cancellation is implemented by `POST /api/setup/cancel`. The backend cancels any currently running setup task and marks that task/checklist item as `failure`. A cancellation request when nothing is running is intentionally harmless.
- For cancellable tasks, storing the `asyncio.Task` worker handle matters. Otherwise a background coroutine can later overwrite a cancellation/failure state after racing with completion.
- Flash cancellation also tracks the subprocess handle so the running `esptool` process can be terminated/killed instead of only cancelling the Python coroutine.
- Firmware settings are intentionally split: application firmware can be either a local build (`local:<build path>`) or a GitHub release asset (`release:<tag>/firmware-*.bin`), while non-application binaries always come from a local PlatformIO build folder containing `bootloader.bin` and `partitions.bin`.
- GitHub release metadata is cached in `factory_interface/src/factory_interface/settings.json`; release assets are downloaded lazily during flashing into the gitignored `factory_interface/github_cache/` folder.

## Local verification

- Distinguish simulator-only iteration from hardware verification. When the user is developing or
  visually evaluating behavior in `sim/`, run the formatter and simulator build/tests, but do not
  run a PlatformIO firmware build, scan serial ports, or flash a physical Leaf unless the user
  explicitly asks for hardware verification. Resume the full workflow below for firmware work that
  is intended for hardware or when the user requests a device build/flash.
- For Leaf firmware work, use this verification workflow:
  1. Run the formatter:
     `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File src\scripts\format_all_files.ps1`
  2. Build-test firmware with the `leaf_3_2_6_release` PlatformIO environment unless the user specifies a different hardware version/environment:
     `C:\Users\oxoth\.platformio\penv\Scripts\pio.exe run -e leaf_3_2_6_release`
  3. Auto-detect the connected ESP32/Leaf COM port instead of hardcoding one. Prefer exactly one port with Espressif VID `303A`, using:
     `C:\Users\oxoth\.platformio\penv\Scripts\python.exe -m serial.tools.list_ports -v`
  4. If exactly one likely ESP32/Leaf COM port is connected, attempt to flash the built firmware. It is acceptable for flashing to fail if the device is not connected or not in boot mode; report the esptool result clearly. If the port appears to be a Leaf USB/mass-storage/app-mode port and esptool fails or the port disappears, wait briefly, re-run the port scan, and retry once if the device re-enumerates as a single Espressif VID `303A` port. This soft "nudge" can move Leaf from app USB mode into a flashable ESP32 port without requiring the user to manually enter boot mode, but it is not guaranteed. Flash the app image to both OTA app slots so the currently selected boot partition does not matter. For the default v3.2.6 build, use:
     `C:\Users\oxoth\.platformio\penv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\oxoth\.platformio\packages\tool-esptoolpy\esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port <AUTO_DETECTED_COM_PORT> --baud 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode qio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size detect 0x10000 .pio\build\leaf_3_2_6_release\firmware.bin 0x340000 .pio\build\leaf_3_2_6_release\firmware.bin`
- `factory_interface` is a Python/uv project under `factory_interface/`; useful quick checks are:
  - `python -m compileall src\factory_interface`
  - `uv run python -c "from factory_interface.app import app; print(app.title)"`
- The app requires the operator cookie for API calls. Browser sessions may already have it, but direct API smoke tests need `factory_interface_operator_name=<name>`.
- Port `8000` may already be in use locally. Starting uvicorn on another port, such as `8001`, works for smoke testing.

## Device emulator (`sim/`)

- `sim/` builds the real firmware for the host and runs it against a virtual ESP32 board: display,
  buttons, SD card, settings, and sensor data played from a recording. See `sim/README.md`.
- Behaviour changes that touch the display, menus, instruments or navigation can be checked without
  hardware:
  `docker run --rm -v "<repo>:/leaf" -w /leaf gcc:13 sh -c "make -C sim -j8 && ./sim/build/leafsim --port 0 --speed 0 --scenario sim/recordings/thermal-climb.json --play --script sim/scripts/first-boot.txt"`
  A script's `expect-page` / `expect-serial` failures set a non-zero exit code, and `screenshot`
  steps write PNGs of the actual screen.
- The emulator needs `.pio/libdeps` populated (one `pio run` is enough) because it compiles against
  the same ETL / ArduinoJson / IgcLogger / FANET versions as the firmware.
- Sensor injection shares one parser with the device: `src/vario/dispatch/message_injector.h` backs
  both the emulator's scenario player and the on-device UDP server, so `sim/play_buslog.py` drives
  either. Changing that wire format changes both.

## Core Dump Analysis

For ESP32 core dump retrieval and analysis:

**Reference**: [Leaf Core Dump Guide](https://leafvario.com/dev-references/core-dumps/)

**Firmware location**: `.pio/build/leaf_3_2_6_dev/firmware.elf`

**Device path (macOS)**: `/dev/tty.usbmodem*`

**Quick steps**:
```bash
cd esp-idf && . ./export.sh
espcoredump.py -p /dev/tty.usbmodem* info_corefile .pio/build/leaf_3_2_6_dev/firmware.elf
```
